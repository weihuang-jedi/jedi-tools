This is a python program to generate IODA V2 format single (or few) observation(s).

For now, it worked for air_temperature.

1. Have base.yaml file, for the ncdump of one IODA V2 obs file

2. have a metadata.yaml file, which define the observations.

	a. latitude/longitude/air_pressure to define the location
	b. datetime to define the time of the obs.
	c. height and station_evelation are not used here.
	d. GsiHofX, GsiHofXBc, and ObsValue to define the observations.

One may not know what GsiHofX, GsiHofXBc, and ObsValue should be at first.
To get a good value for: GsiHofX, GsiHofXBc, and ObsValue
One can do this for steps:

1. Set some guess value for: GsiHofX, GsiHofXBc, and ObsValue.
   Run GETKF, and check ioda output obs file. find goog value for
   them, such as from one of those hofx value.

2. use the new value for: GsiHofX, GsiHofXBc, and ObsValue,
   and re-run this program.
